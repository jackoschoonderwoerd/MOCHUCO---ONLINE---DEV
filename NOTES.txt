I have created PWA using angular in which I am using zxing-ngx-scanner library, which library for barcode scan. In ios browsers(Safari, Chrome and Firefox) and on Android it's asking for camera permissions and it's working fine, but if I add my site to homescreen(in ios), then it's not asking me for the camera permissions.

Try to upgrade to iOS 13.4 and try again. The fix that Apple provided may work now.
